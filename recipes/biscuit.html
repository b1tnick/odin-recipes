  <h2 class="recipe-headers">Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    Here's what you need:
    <li>
      <p><strong>Flour</strong></p>
      <p>
        All-purpose flour holds the ingredients together. Also, the protein in
        flour (when combined with moisture and heat) creates gluten, which
        provides structure.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Baking Powder</strong></p>
      <p>
        Baking powder, not yeast, is used as a leavener in this easy biscuit
        recipe. It causes the dough to expand, giving the biscuits volume and
        texture.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Salt</strong></p>
      <p>
        Salt acts as a flavor enhancer and it strengthens the protein in the
        dough.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Shortening</strong></p>
      <p>
        Shortening is made of purely fat, unlike butter which contains water and
        milk solids. This means it's better at reducing (or "shortening!")
        gluten strands, resulting in a soft and crumbly biscuit.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Milk</strong></p>
      <p>
        Cold milk adds moisture, flavor, and structure to the biscuit dough.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

    How to make biscuits
    <li>
      <p><strong>Prepare the Dough</strong></p>
      <p>
        Sift the dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, and salt) into a large
        bowl. Cut in the shortening, then add the milk. Mix until the dough is
        soft and doesn't stick to the side of the bowl.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Knead and Roll</strong></p>
      <p>
        Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly.
        Roll the dough into an even sheet that's about Â½-inch thick.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Cut and Bake</strong></p>
      <p>
        Use a lightly floured biscuit cutter to cut out the biscuits. Place the
        cut biscuits on an ungreased baking sheet. Re-roll the dough, repeating
        the cutting process, until all the dough is gone. Bake in an oven
        preheated to 450 degrees F until golden brown.
